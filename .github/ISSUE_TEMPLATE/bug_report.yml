              **Thanks ü©∑ for taking the time to fill out this bug report! Before proceeding, please read the following**

              Make sure a similar issue doesn't already exist by [searching the existing issues](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for keywords!

              Make sure both Vesktop and Vencord are fully up to date. You can update Vencord by right-clicking the Vesktop tray icon and pressing "Update Vencord"

              **DO NOT REPORT** any of the following issues:
              - GPU related issues. These are **you** issues and you have to fix them. You can disable hardware acceleration or run with --disable-gpu. 
                - Purely graphical glitches like flickering, scaling issues
                - App crashing with mentions of the gpu process in the stacktrace
                - Screenshare not starting, black screening or crashing
              - Vencord related issues: This is the Vesktop repo, not Vencord
              
              Linux users: Please only report issues with supported packages (flatpak and any builds from the README / releases).
              We do not support other packages, like the AUR or Nix packages, so please first make sure your issue is reproducible with official releases,
              like [our Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/dev.vencord.Vesktop) or [AppImage](https://vencord.dev/download/vesktop/amd64/appimage)
